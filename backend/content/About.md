Practice Project: To Do List Web App

The hands-on project is to develop a task list web application, which will allow users to create, edit, and delete tasks in a custom list. The application will be developed using Python as the backend language and React as the frontend language, and it will have an attractive and modern design thanks to the use of Bootstrap as the design framework.

To begin with, a requirements analysis will be carried out to define the functionalities that will be implemented in the application. Once the requirements have been defined, the backend will be implemented using Python and a web development framework such as Flask. The backend will be in charge of performing the operations of creating, editing and deleting tasks in the database, as well as managing user authentication and authorization.

Subsequently, the frontend of the application will be developed using React and Bootstrap. The frontend will take care of displaying the task list and allowing the user to interact with it, as well as providing an attractive and easy-to-use interface. Additionally, it will integrate with the backend by using API calls to perform task creation, editing, and deletion operations securely.

Once the development of the application is finished, it will proceed to carry out functional and performance tests to ensure its correct operation and optimization. Finally, the application will be deployed on a web server so that it is accessible to any user with Internet access.

In summary, the practice project is to develop a task list web application using Python as the backend and React with Bootstrap as the frontend. This app will allow users to create, edit, and delete tasks in a custom list, and it will feature an attractive design and user-friendly interface.
